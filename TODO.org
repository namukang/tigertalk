* Core
** TODO Add nicks
   - Eventually we want to use Net IDs instead of user chosen nicks

* Bugs
** TODO Get rid of ticket information in URL after authenticating
   - Possible approach:
     - if GET '/' with no query:
       - redirect to CAS
     - if GET '/' with ticket query:
       - POST to '/' with ticket query
     - if POST '/':
       - read ticket and validate
** TODO Width 100% overflows with padding
** TODO Only scroll to bottom when user is already fully scrolled
** TODO Whitespace in beginning of message is ignored in table (feature?)

* Engagement
** TODO Add backlog
   - Useful for engaging users the moment they enter the chatroom
** DONE Add unread messages to document title
   - Listen for browser events (blur, focus) so we know when the focus
     is on window
   - Every time a message comes in, increment unread_msgs count unless
     focus is on window
** TODO Bold nick when you sent message
   - Check nick property when receiving message
** TODO Highlight messages that you're mentioned in
   - Regexp on message field when receiving message
